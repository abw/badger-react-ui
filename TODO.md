# TODO

## General

* Consistent policy for handler functions (e.g. in Search, Select, etc).
The `onLoad` and `onUnload` handlers should *probably* pass the object
itself.  Others, e.g. `onFocus`, `onBlur`, etc., should *probably* pass
the context returned from `getContext()`

* Have `Children` for headless components which will render functions.

## Styling

* Search and Select should share styles for results/options and should inherit
from form styles

# Components

## Search

* NoResults

## Select

* NoOptions

# Website / Docs

* sub-headings in menus
