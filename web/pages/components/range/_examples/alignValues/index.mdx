  The `alignValues` property (or `alignValue` as an alias) can be set to
  specified to set the alignment of the current values.

  The default value is `thumb` which will align the values with their
  respective draggable thumbs. It can also be set to `space` which will place
  the minium value at the left edge and the maximum value at the right.

  This option only has an effect when <CodeHashLink id="showValues"/> is set.
  You can also use the `alignMinValue` and `alignMaxValue` properties
  to set them individually to `thumb`, `space`, `left` or `right`.  The value
  specified will be added as a CSS class to the corresponding value element.
