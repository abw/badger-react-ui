  The `onChangeValue` property can be set as an alternative to the `onChange`
  handler function.  It is particularly useful when using stepped values or
  options.  It will only fire when the minimum or maximum value has change
  sufficiently to set a new stepped value.  This can greatly reduce the
  number of events fired compared to the `onChange` handler.
