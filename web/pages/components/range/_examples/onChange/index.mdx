  The `onChange` property can be set as a handler function which will be
  called when either the `minValue` or `maxValue` changes.  The function will
  be called with the `minValue` and `maxValue` passed as arguments.
  The third argument is the context state object containing all current
  values in case you need to inspect something else.
