  You can define your own layout for the component using a combination of the
  built-in components and your own code.

  Inside the scope of the `Range` element, any children can access the context
  using the `useRange` hook.  Immediate children of the `Range` component can
  also be functions which will receive an object containing all the context
  properties as an argument.

  In this example we first render the `RangeOutput` and `RangeSlider`
  sub-components (lines 10 and 11). Then we include several copies of the
  custom `SetMin` (lines 14-16) and `SetMax` (lines 19-21) components which
  use the `useRange` hook to access the `setMinValue` and `setMaxValue`
  functions respectively (lines 48 and 58).

  The final block of code (lines 24 to 44) demonstrates a function which
  receives the `setValues` function as a property which it can then call
  directly.
