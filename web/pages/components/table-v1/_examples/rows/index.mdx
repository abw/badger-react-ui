  The `rows` (or `bodyRows`) property is used to define an array of rows for
  the main table body. Each element in the `rows` array can be an array of
  cells. Or it can be an object containing an array of cells as the `cells`
  property and any other properties for the row (e.g. `className` to set the
  CSS class for the row).

  Each cell can be a simple text string or other value, or an object
  containing the value as the `text` property, along with any other properties
  for the cell (e.g. `className`).

  Cells in the header are rendered as `th` elements.  Cells in the body and
  footer are rendered as `td` element.  The boolean `th` property can be added
  to a cell to change this behaviour.
