<Heading title="Context"/>

A react context is created which provides the items listed below.
Any other properties passed in to the component will also be
accessible to child components.

Values are provided for the 0-based indexes of the first, last,
previous, next and current pages. For example, the lowest value for `page`
is `0` and the highest value is `pages - 1`.  Their counterparts are also
provided in "human readable" 1-based form with a `No` suffix.  For example,
the values for `pageNo` range from `1` to `pages`, and will always be one
more than `page`.

<DescTable
  items={[
    ['pages',   'The total number of pages, as passed into the component as a property.'],
    ['page',    'The index (0 based) of the current page, as passed into the component as a property.'],
    ['setPage', 'The function for setting a page index, as passed into the component as a property.'],
    ['pageNo',  'The current page number (1 based), effectively one louder than `page`.  e.g. if `page` is ten then this goes up to eleven.' ],
    ['firstPage',  'The index (0 based) of the first page.  This is always 0 but is included for completeness.'],
    ['firstPageNo',  'The number (1 based) of the first page.  This is always 1 but is included for completeness.'],
    ['lastPage',     'The index (0 based) of the last page.'],
    ['lastPageNo',   'The number (1 based) of the first page.'],
    ['prevPage',     'The index (0 based) of the previous page.'],
    ['prevPageNo',   'The number (1 based) of the previous page.'],
    ['nextPage',     'The index (0 based) of the next page.'],
    ['nextPageNo',   'The number (1 based) of the next page.'],

<Section title="Custom Components">
  You can provide your own components to render certain elements
  of the pager widget. These will be passed relevant parameters as
  properties and can use the `usePager()` hook
  to access the full pager context, including any additional properties
  that you pass to the `Pager` component.

  In this example we define a custom `MyPageButton` component
  to replace the `Page` component that renders the numbered
  page buttons.  Instead of displaying page numbers it shows alphabetical
  ranges for each button, defined in a custom `pageRanges`
  property.
  <Example
    Component={Component}
    code={Source}
    highlightLines="4-18,34"
  />
</Section>
