  The `HeadRow` property allows you to define your own component for rendering
  rows in the header.  This will override any value defined for `Row`.

  This example shows two different ways to render a cell in the `HeadRow`.
  You can use `TableCell` and set the `th` property.  Or you can use `TableTh`
  which has the same effect.

  A cell can be a simple string, a function returning any renderable content
  (i.e. `React.ReactNode`) or an object containing a `text` property and other
  attributes for the cell element.

  In both cases we use the `tableCellProps` function to handle the case where
  a cell might be an object containing other attributes for the cell.  If
  you're sure that your rows will only contain text then you can directly
  embed the cell content as shown in the `Row` component on lines 15 and 16.
  If you're using Typescript then you'll need to add an `as string` assertion
  if you want to avoid the red squigglies from Typescript.
