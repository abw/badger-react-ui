  The `Row` property allows you to define your own component for rendering
  rows.  It can generate the cells directly or use the `TableCell` component
  to generate them.

  It will be passed a `th` flag indicating if the row is expected to generate
  `th` cells instead of `td`. This would be true when the table header is
  being rendered.  You can forward this property to the `TableCell` component
  and it will take care of it for you.

  The `tableCellProps` utility function can be used to handle cells that are
  either simple values (strings, numbers, etc) and those that are objects.
  It will convert a simple value to an object of the form `{ text: ... }`.

  If you're using Typescript then you can type the component using the
  `TableRowComponent` type.
