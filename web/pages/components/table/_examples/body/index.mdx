  The `body` property is used to define an array of rows for the main table
  body. Each element in the `body` array can be an array of cells. Or it can
  be an object containing an array of cells as the `cells` property and any
  other properties for the row (e.g. `className` to set the CSS class for the
  row).

  Each cell can be a simple text string or other value, a function returning
  any renderable content, or an object containing the value as the `text`
  property along with any other attributes you want to add to the cell
  element (e.g. `className`).

  Cells in the header are rendered as `th` elements.  Cells in the body and
  footer are rendered as `td` element.  The boolean `th` property can be added
  to a cell to change this behaviour.
</Example>

You can also define the `body` as an object with the rows defined as the `rows`
property.  This allows you to specify other properties that should be added
to the `tbody` HTML element as attributes.

```tsx
<Table
  body={{
    className: 'my-body-class',
    rows: [
      ['Nigel Tufnel', 'Guitar'],
      ['David St. Hubbins', 'Guitar'],
      ['Derek Smalls', 'Bass'],
      ['Viv Savage', 'Keyboards'],
    ]
  }}
/>
```

If you only have a single row in the `body` (or more likely, in the `head`
or `foot` sections), then you can define it as an array of cells (rather than
an array containing a single array of cells).

```tsx
<Table
  head={[ 'Name', 'Instrument' ]}
  // shortcut for:
  // head={[ ['Name', 'Instrument'] ]}
/>
```
