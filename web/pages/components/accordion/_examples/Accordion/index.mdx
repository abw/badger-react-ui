  The `Accordion` component can be used to create a
  number of revealable sections.  It is implemented as a simple
  wrapper around the <DetailsLink/> component.
</div>

Any properties other than those listed below will be forwarded on to
the <DetailsLink/> component. For example, you can add the{' '}
`border` and `lined` properties to set the
appropriate styling.

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
