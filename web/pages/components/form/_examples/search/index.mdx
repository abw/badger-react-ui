<Section code="search">
  The field `type` property can be set to `search` to use the <SearchLink/>
  component. You can define additional properties in the field that will be
  forwarded to the select component.  For example, see the `onSearch` handler
  defined below.

  <Example
    Component={Search}
    code={SearchSrc}
    highlightLines="34-35"
  />

  When an option is selected the default behaviour is to return the complete
  option, as shown in the first field in the example below. You can use the
  `selectValue` property to define a function which will accept the option
  and return the relevant value from inside it.  This is shown in the second
  field in the example below which returns the `value` property from the
  option instead of the selected option object.

  <Example
    Component={Select}
    code={SelectSrc}
    highlightLines="46"
  />
</Section>
