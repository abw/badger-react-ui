  You can call the `reset` method on the search object to reset the search.
  Note that it will be reset to the original state, so if an initial value
  was provided to the component then that will be restored.  Use the `clear`
  method if you want to clear the input instead.

  Try changing the values in the search components below.  Clicking on
  the first reset button will reset the first component to a blank state.
  Clicking on the second reset button will reset the second component
  to its original state, containing the value "Ben Badger".
