  You should provide an `onSearch` function which will be passed the search
  input and should return an array of results.  This can be an asynchronous
  function if necessary.  For example, a function which makes an API request
  to fetch the matching results.

  If your function throws an error (try entering "throw" as a search option)
  then it will be caught and displayed as an error.
