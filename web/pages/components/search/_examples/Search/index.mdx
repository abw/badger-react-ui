<div className="large">
  The `Search` component implements the familiar "autocomplete" functionality.
</div>

The user starts typing and after a short debounce delay a set of results
matching their input is displayed.

The user can then click on a result or use the keyboard to navigate through
the results.

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
/>
