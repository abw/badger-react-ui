  The component does not call the `onSearch` handler immediately when the
  user enters a search value.  Instead it introduces a short delay known
  as the "debounce time".  Think of it as a timer which is started whenever
  the user enters a character.  If they enter another character before the
  timer has elapsed then the timer is reset.  This is particularly useful when
  the component is calling a network API.  It allows the user to "finish
  typing" (for some definition of "finish") before making the API call.

  The default value is 500 milliseconds.  The `debounceTime` property can be
  used to set a different value.
