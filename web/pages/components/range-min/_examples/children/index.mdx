  You can define your own layout for the component using a combination of the
  built-in components and your own code.

  Inside the scope of the `RangeMin` element, any children can access the
  context using the `useRange` hook.  Immediate children of the `RangeMin`
  component can also be functions which will receive an object containing all
  the context properties as an argument.

  In this example we first render the `RangeOutput` and `RangeSlider`
  sub-components (lines 10 and 11). Then we include several copies of the
  custom `SetMin` component (lines 13-17) which uses the `useRange` hook to
  access the `setMinValue` function (line 39).

  The final block of code (lines 19 to 35) demonstrates a function which
  receives the `setMinValue` function as a property which it can then call
  directly.
