  The `showTicks` property can be specified to display a series of ticks along
  the slider to indicate the steps.  This is only valid when the
  <CodeHashLink id="step"/> property is set.  Note, however, that the default
  value for <CodeHashLink id="step"/> is `1` and the default values for
  <CodeHashLink id="min"/> and <CodeHashLink id="max"/> are `0` and `100`,
  respectively.  So you'll get 100 ticks by default which probably isn't what
  you want.

  See the <CodeHashLink id="tickStep"/> property below which allows you to
  set a different step for the ticks.
