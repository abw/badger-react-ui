  The `border` property can be used to add a CSS class to add a border around
  the component.  By itself it will add a one pixel border.  You can also set
  it to an integer (in pixels) for a wider border.  The same border width will
  also be applied to the line separating the summary and content when the
  `lined` property is used.
