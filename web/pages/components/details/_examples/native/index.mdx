  Earlier versions (before 1.0.11) used the native `details` and `summary`
  HTML elements.  However there appear to be some problems with content inside
  the body overflowing when the `width` is set to `100%`, as shown in the
  second example below.  So more recent versions use `div.details` and
  `div.summary` as the elements.  These are styled the same but avoid the
  content width problems.

  You can set the `native` property if you want to use the
  native `details` and `summary` HTML elements.
