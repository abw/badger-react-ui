  You can define your own `searchOptions` function to search through the
  `options` and return matching results.

  The first argument passed is the search string.  The second argument is the
  array of options.  The function should filter the options and return those
  that match the search string according to whatever logic you care to
  implement.

  In this example we implement a search function which will match against
  the user's `name` or their `department`.  Try entering `an`.  It will match
  Al<b>an</b>, and <b>An</b>ne by name, and also Brenda and Bruce from
  M<b>an</b>agement.
