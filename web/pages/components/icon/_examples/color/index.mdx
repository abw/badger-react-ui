  The `color` property is a short-cut to set the color.  This adds the color
  to the CSS class. The `color` can be be comprised of up to 5 elements
  separated by hyphens.  The first is the color range, e.g. `red`, `green`,
  `blue`, etc.  The second is the stop number for the foreground.  This is an
  integer from 0 (darkest) to 100 (lightest) in steps of 5.  The third is the
  stop number for the background.  The remaining two numbers are stops for the
  foreground and background colors in dark mode.
