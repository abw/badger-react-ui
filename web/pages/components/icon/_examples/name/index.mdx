  The `name` property can be used to select an icon from the default icon
  library. Additional modifiers and classes can be added to the name to apply
  styles and transformations.  e.g. `arrow-right` rotates the `arrow` icon
  through 90&deg; so that it points to the right.

  The `name` can include multiple icons, each of which can have dashed
  modifiers and dotted CSS classes.  Each should be separated by whitespace.
  The separate icons will be stacked on top of each other to create a
  composite icon.

  See the <BadgerIconLink/> documentation for further details.
