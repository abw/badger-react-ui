              I do not, for one, think that the problem was that the
              band was down. I think that the problem may have been...
              that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that
              was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf. Alright? That
              tended to understate the hugeness of the object.

        May I make a suggestion? May I make a suggestion?
        I&apos;ve got one other suggestion.

      <p>
        Well let&apos;s hear yours. Let&apos;s hear your suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stonehenge! It&apos;s the best production value we&apos;ve
        ever had on stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we haven&apos;t got the equipment. We haven&apos;t got the
        equipment, we haven&apos;t got Stonehenge, we haven&apos;t...
      </p>
      <p>
        Not yet we don&apos;t. Let&apos;s start... Musically, musically
        we all know it. Musically we all know it. Right? No
        problems musically. We go right on stage. And it&apos;s quite
        simple. This is you know... Ian can take care of this...
      </p>
      <p>
        I know what the Stonehenge monument looks like.
        We don&apos;t have that piece of scenery anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, so we build a new one. And this is it, look!
