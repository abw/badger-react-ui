  The above components are implemented using `MakeSortable`.

  In most cases you don't need to worry about this.  However, if you're trying
  to render a sortable table then you may see React warnings telling you that
  a `div` element cannot appear as a child of a `tr` element or something
  similar. The reason for this is that <DNDKitLink/> creates a `div` wrapper
  for the sortable context and it will put it wherever you've inserted the
  `Sortable` component.

  The solution is to use `MakeSortable`, passing it all the options supported
  by `Sortable`.  It will return an object containing `Context` and `Content`
  components. Put the `Context` around the outside of your table and then
  insert the `Content` where you want the sortable items to appear.
