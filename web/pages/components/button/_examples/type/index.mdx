  The default `type` for a button is set to `button`. In most cases this has
  no effect.  However, inside the scope of a `form` element, the `type` for a
  button would usually default to being `submit`.  When clicked, the button
  would submit the form.

  This behaviour usually surprises people (it certainly catches me out from
  time to time).  Having an explicit default button type prevents this from
  happening.  When you really do want to add a button to submit a form, you
  should explicitly set the `type` to `submit`.  You can also set it to
  `reset` to make a reset button for a form.
