<Section code="columns">
  The `columns` property is used to define which properties in the `rows`
  you want to display. For simple cases this can be a string containing a
  whitespace delimited list of properties.

  <Example
    Component={String}
    code={StringSrc}
    caption="columns"
    highlightLines="3"
    expand={false}
    undent={2}
  />

  The string format is short-hand for specifying an array of strings.

  <Example
    Component={Array}
    code={ArraySrc}
    caption="columns"
    highlightLines="3-8"
    expand={false}
    undent={2}
  />

  When a column is defined as a string it is "upgraded" to
  an object in which the string is the `field` property.
  This should (usually) correspond to a property in each row that
  you want to display in the column.

  <Example
    Component={ArrayField}
    code={ArrayFieldSrc}
    caption="columns"
    highlightLines="3-8"
    expand={false}
    undent={2}
  />

  The column object will be augmented with some additional properties:
  `id` (the same value as the field, for sorting purposes),
  `heading` (or `label`) used as the column heading
  and defaulting to a capitalised version of the `field`,
  and `type` defaulting to `text`.
  You can define different values for `heading` and
  `type` (along with other properties
  <a href="#column-properties">detailed below</a>).
  In this example we set the `type` of the
  first column to be `number`.  If you click on the
  `Id` column heading in one of the previous example, you
  can see that it's sorting the rows alphabetically, e.g.
  10, 101, 102, 103, 11, 12, etc.  Setting the column type to
  `number`, as shown in the next example, fixes this problem
  and the rows will be sorted numerically, e.g. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20,
  etc.

  <Example
    Component={ArrayObj}
    code={ArrayObjSrc}
    caption="columns"
    highlightLines="3-8"
    expand={false}
    undent={2}
  />

  The final option is to define the columns as an object in which the
  keys are the field names and the values contain additional configuration
  options for the column.  These can be defined as empty objects or a
  true value if you're happy with the default values for
  `heading` and `type`.  You can also explicitly set
  a column to `false` if you don't want it displayed.

  <Example
    Component={Object}
    code={ObjectSrc}
    caption="columns"
    highlightLines="3-8"
    expand={false}
    undent={2}
  />

  See the <a href="#column-properties">Column Properties</a> section
  below for further information about the properties that can be added
  to the `columns`.
