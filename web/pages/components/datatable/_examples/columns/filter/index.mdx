  The `filter` property can be used to implement custom filtering. If you try
  filtering the rows in the previous example you'll notice that it doesn't
  work.  It's for the same reason that we need to implement a custom `sort`
  function - there isn't a `name` column in the row data to filter on.

  The `filter` property lets us define a custom filter function to take care
  of it.  It is passed an object containing a `row` and the `search` value
  that it should filter on.  You can implement your own filter logic which
  should return a boolean value indicating if the row matches or not.  Or you
  can use one of the built in functions like `filterStringContains()` as
  shown in this example.  We just need to provide it with a `value`
  constructed as a composite of the `forename` and `surname` fields in the
  `row`.  It will look for the `search` appearing anywhere in the `value`
  string in a case insensitive manner.

  There's also the `filterStringExact()` function which performs an exact
  string match.  The `filterInteger()` and `filterFloat()` functions filter
  integer and floating point values respectively and they take care of the
  coercing string values (such as those entered into the search input) into
  the appropriate types. The `filterBoolean()` can be used for filter boolean
  values and will also perform the appropriate type coercion.
