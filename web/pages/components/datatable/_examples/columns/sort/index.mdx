  The `sort` property can be used to implement custom sorting. This is
  particularly useful if you have a composite column as shown in this example.

  Here we display a composite name constructed from the `forename` and
  `surname` fields.  The datatable can't automatically sort on the `name`
  column because there isn't a `name` column in the data.  So we define
  the `sort` property using the <BadgerUtilsLink path="sort.html#multiSort"
  code="multisort"/> utility function from <BadgerUtilsLink/>. This returns a
  function that sorts the rows by surname first and then by forename.
