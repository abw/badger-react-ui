  The `hidden` property can be set to `true` to prevent the column from
  being initially displayed.

  The columns will still be listed in the columns dropdown menu for
  subsequent selection

  The `visible` property can also be set to be `false` for backwards
  compatibility with earlier versions.  However it is recommended that all
  new code use `hidden` because it's more logically consistent.  If `hidden`
  is not specified then it is assumed to be `false`.  On the contrary, if
  `visible` is not specified then it is assumed to be `true` which can be
  counterintuitive.
