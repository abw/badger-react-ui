  The `filterType` property can be used to define a different type for the
  filtering component.  This is typically set to `select` when you want to
  implement a dropdown menu for filtering, but want to use a different column
  `type` (e.g. `number`) for sorting.

  In this example we define the `filterType` for the `id` column to be
  `select`, with the main `type` set to `id`.  The objects in the
  `selectOptions` array have a `value` which is a range for filtering ids.
  The `filter` function then uses that to filter rows.
