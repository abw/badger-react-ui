  The `useDataTable` hook can be called to return the DataTable context.
  This contains all the DataTable state data, including any additional
  properties passed to the DataTable.

  In this example we define a `display` function for the `text` column. The
  function is passed an object containing the `row` and the `rowIndex` which
  is the offset (starting at 0) in the current page of rows.  The
  `useDataTable()` hook returns the current `page` which has the `from`
  property indicating the current row number (starting at 1 - use `firstIndex`
  if you want to row offset starting at 0). Adding them together gives the
  overall row number.

  The `rowClass` function also calls `useDataTable()`, in this case to access
  the `statusClasses` lookup table that was passed to the DataTable as an
  additional property.
