<div className="large">
  The `DataTable` component can be used to display, sort, filter and page
  sets of data.
</div>

<Warning title="Important Note" border icon="exclamation">
  There were some breaking changes in version 1.1.0.
  This component was previously called `Datatable` and has
  been renamed to `DataTable` (note the capital T).
  The old name is still supported as an alias but will be removed at
  some point in the future
</Warning>

The two mandatory properties are `rows` and `columns`. The `rows` should be
an array of objects containing the data that you want to display.  The
`columns` defines which properties in those objects you want to display.
In the simple case this can be a string of whitespace delimited identifiers.
These should correspond to properties in the objects in the `rows` array.

Click on the column headings to set the sort order.  Clicking again on the
same column heading will toggle the order between ascending and descending.
Click on the small filter icon to show/hide the filters.  You can then type
into the filter value for each column to filter the rows.

The "Page Size" dropdown menu in the top right corner allows you to specify
how many rows appear on each page.  The "Columns" item next to it allows you
to specify which columns should be displayed.  You can drag them to change
the order of columns.
