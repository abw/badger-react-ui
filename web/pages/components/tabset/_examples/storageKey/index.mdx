  The `storageKey` property can be used to define a key for the tab state to
  be stored in local storage.  Try selecting the "Eleven" tab (it's one
  louder) in the example below and then reload the page.  You should see the
  tab selection preserved.

  The `storageKey` should usually be unique for each tabset in your web site.
  e.g. a tabset on your home page could use `home-tabs` and a tabset on your
  "Contact Us" page could use `contact-tabs`.
