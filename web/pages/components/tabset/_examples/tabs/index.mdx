  The `tabs` property should be used to define an array of objects containing
  properties for each tab.  This can include `text` for the tab text, `icon`
  for a tab icon, `iconLeft` and `iconRight` for icons to appear either side
  of the text, and `disabled` to disable the tab

  A `content` property can be defined containing the content that should be
  rendered when the tab is select. Alternately you can provide a `Component`
  which should be a React component. This will be passed the active `tab` as
  a property.
