  The `useToggle` hook can be called to return an array containing the
  currently selected `option` and a `Toggle` component.  You can render the
  component multiple times and each instance will share the same state.
  Additional properties can be passed each time you render it.

  The third item returned in the array is a function to programmatically
  select an option.  You can specify either the numerical index of the
  item or the `value` for the option. The fourth item returned is a function
  to step through each option in turn.
