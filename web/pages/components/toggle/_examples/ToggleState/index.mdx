  The `ToggleState` component is a wrapper around the `Toggle` component
  which maintains the state of the selected option internally.  Use the
  `onSelect` handler to get notification when a new option is selected.

  You can also define a `storageKey` to store the selected option in local
  storage.  Try selecting an option below and then reload the page.  You
  should see the option selection restored.
