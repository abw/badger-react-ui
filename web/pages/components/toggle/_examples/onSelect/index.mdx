  The `onSelect` property should be used to provider a handler which will be
  called when an option is selected.  It is passed two arguments: the `option`
  object and the numerical index of the option in the `options` array.

  You can safely use the second argument, the numerical index, as the value to
  store for the `selected` option.  You can use the first argument, the option
  object as long as each option has a `value` property to uniquely identify it.
