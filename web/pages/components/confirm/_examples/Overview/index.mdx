<div className="large">
  The `Confirm` component provides an extra safety net for potentially
  dangerous operations.  When the user click on the button it then prompts
  them to confirm or cancel the action.
</div>

Additional properties not listed below are forwarded onto the initial button.
For example, you can set the `text`, `color`, add icons, and so on, just like
you would for any other button.

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  expand
/>
