# Theme Provider

<div className="large">
  The components can be themed using <OneLouderLink/>.
</div>

This allows you to define a theme that provides default properties
for the various components in the library.

Import the `Theme` component and define a `Theme.Provider` around your app or
a section of it. Pass it your theme configuration as its properties.

Any components rendered inside the provider context will use the default
properties that you have defined.  In the example below we set the default
`placeholder` for the `Select` component, and default `color` and `iconRight`
properties for the `Button` component.

These are only default values and can be overridden by providing a component
with specific values, as shown for the second button in the example.

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  highlightLines="5-17,19,31"
  expand
/>
