# Installation

## Adding to a Javascript Project

Add `@abw/badger-react-ui` to your Javascript project
using your favourite package manager.

## Importing the CSS

The precise details on how you import the CSS will vary depending on
what framework and bundler you're using.  For a React app using
Vite or running under Next.js, for example, you can add the CSS file
to your main application script as show here.

For other frameworks and/or bundlers you should consult the documentation on
how to import a CSS file from a module in your `node_modules` directory.

## Includes Badger CSS!

Note that the example shown above imports the stylesheets that *includes* the
styles from Badger CSS.  If you're already using Badger CSS and have it
imported, or if you've customised your installation of Badger CSS, then you
only need to import the additional styles for Badger React UI.

## Importing the SCSS

If you're using SASS/SCSS to build your stylesheet then you can import the
SCSS components. Add the following line to your main SCSS stylesheet source
to import the Badger CSS and Badger React UI components.

<Snippet
  file="getting-started/badger-css-react-ui-scss.scss"
  caption="Combined SCSS for Badger CSS / React UI"
  expand
/>

Or if you're already importing the Badger CSS components, possibly to
customise it in some way, then you only need to import the
`badger-react-ui.scss` file.

  file="getting-started/badger-react-ui-scss.scss"
