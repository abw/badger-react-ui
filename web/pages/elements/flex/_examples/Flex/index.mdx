<div className="large">
  The `Flex` component is a shortcut for adding flex classes.
</div>

It supports the same properties as the <DivLink/> component and some
additional ones that are specific to flex layout.

Behind the scenes, using the `Flex` component is exactly the same as using
the <DivLink/> component with a `flex` property.

Also note that the properties listed below that set the `align-items` CSS
property (`start`, `middle`, `baseline` and `end`) also apply when using grid
layout.

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
/>
