<div className="large">
  The `Div` component is a utility for creating a `div` element.  It uses the
  <Link to="/utilities/classes" text="CSS utility classes"/> to construct
  a CSS class from the properties passed to it.
</div>

The properties listed below have some additional processing applied to them.
All other properties are added to the generated CSS class. For example, you
can add the `inverse`  and `blue` properties and the generated CSS class
will be `inverse blue`.

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  expand
/>
