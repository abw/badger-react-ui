# useContainer

<div className="large">
  The hook can be used to monitor the width and height of the content area
  of an element.
</div>

It returns a `ref` which should be attached to the element you want to
monitor.  It also returns the element `width` and `height` in pixels (rounded
to the nearest integer) and the `breakpoint` name corresponding to the width.

The `width` and `height` refer to the size of the element's content area.
That is the internal size inside any borders or padding. The `boxWidth` and
`boxHeight` are also provided if you want the external size.

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  expand
/>
