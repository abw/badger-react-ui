  The default behaviour for creating a setter name is to capitalise the first
  letter of the corresponding value.  For example, if you define a `badger`
  value then the setter will be `setBadger`.  However, it only capitalises
  the first letter, so if you have a value like `amplifier_volume` then the
  setter will be `setAmplifier_volume`.

  You can define your own `convertCase` function as an option. In this
  example, we use the <BadgerUtilsLink path="text.html#snakeToStudly"
  code="snakeToStudly()"/> function from <BadgerUtilsLink/> which fully
  converts the snake case value into studly caps, giving us a setter named
  `setAmplifierVolume`.

  Obviously this is a rather contrived example, but it can be useful if you're
  working with data sources that use snake case.
