  The `colorClass` utility function can be used to construct a CSS class for
  defining colors.  The format for the argument is a color range name
  optionally followed by one to four color stop numbers, separated by hyphens.
  The first number is the foreground color stop, used to add an `fgc-N` CSS
  class. The second in the background color stop, adding a `bgc-N` class.
  The third and fourth numbers are the foreground and background color stops
  in dark mode, adding `fgd-N` and `bgd-N` classes respectively.
