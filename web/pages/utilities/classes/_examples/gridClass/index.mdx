  The `gridClass` utility function can be used to construct a CSS class for a
  grid layout.  When used as a boolean flag it sets the CSS class to `grid-1`
  (useful for a single column layout where you want vertical gaps between
  each element).  Or it can be a number to set the number of columns, or
  `fit` or `fill` to add the `grid-fit` and `grid-fill` classes respectively.
