  Badger React UI provides a number of UI components for building
  interactive React web sites.  I built these components over a number
  of years to do the things that I needed doing in the way I like them
  to be done.  There are countless other UI toolkits for React and I make
  no claim that this is any better (or worse).  It was written by me,
  for me, and you're welcome to use it if you think it could be
  good for you too.
</div>

This collection is supposed to be a starting point, not a final destination.
You can use the components and styles provided, but at some point you will
probably want or need to dig in and start adding your own code, or modifying
the builtin components.

Everything is modular and themeable, so that's generally quite easy to
achieve.  But it requires a reasonable knowledge of React, CSS and SASS.
The documentation is provided as a reference for me (and my colleagues) to
use, and it assumes a fairly high level of proficiency in these areas.

Or to put it another way, if you're expecting someone to hold your hand
explaining how to get this up and running, then you've probably come to the
wrong place.
